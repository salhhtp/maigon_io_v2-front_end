# Email Management Implementation

## Overview

The application now implements a proper email management system for user onboarding:

1. **Sign-up Process**: Users provide their information (no password required)
2. **Temporary Password Generation**: System generates a secure temporary password
3. **Email Delivery**: Credentials are sent via email to the user
4. **First-time Login**: User signs in with temporary password
5. **Password Change**: User is prompted to change their password immediately

## Components Added

### Frontend Components

- **`EmailService`** (`client/services/emailService.ts`)
  - Handles email sending logic
  - Generates HTML email templates
  - Falls back to console logging in development

- **`ChangePassword`** (`client/pages/ChangePassword.tsx`)
  - Password change form for temporary passwords
  - Password strength validation
  - Automatic redirect after successful change

### Backend Integration

- **Supabase Edge Functions**:
  - `send-welcome-email`: Sends welcome emails with credentials
  - `send-password-reset`: Handles password reset emails

### Updated Authentication Flow

- **`SupabaseUserContext`**: Enhanced with temporary password handling
- **`RootRedirect`**: Redirects users with temporary passwords to change-password page
- **`SignIn`**: Handles temporary password detection and routing

## Development Mode

In development, email credentials are logged to console:

```
=== WELCOME EMAIL (DEV MODE) ===
To: user@example.com
Subject: Welcome to Maigon - Your Login Credentials
Temporary Password: Abc123!@#
Login URL: http://localhost:5173/signin
================================
```

## Production Setup

### 1. Deploy Supabase Edge Functions

```bash
supabase functions deploy send-welcome-email
supabase functions deploy send-password-reset
```

### 2. Configure Email Service (Resend)

1. Sign up for [Resend](https://resend.com)
2. Get your API key
3. Set environment variable in Supabase:

```bash
supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 3. Configure Email Domain

- Add your domain to Resend
- Update the `from` field in Edge Functions to use your domain:
  ```typescript
  from: 'Maigon <noreply@yourdomain.com>'
  ```

## User Flow

### New User Registration

1. User fills out sign-up form (no password field)
2. System creates account with temporary password
3. Welcome email sent with:
   - Login credentials
   - Temporary password
   - Login link
   - Instructions

### First-time Login

1. User receives email with temporary credentials
2. User signs in with temporary password
3. System detects temporary password and redirects to `/change-password`
4. User must change password before accessing the application
5. After password change, user is redirected to dashboard

### Password Requirements

- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)

## Testing the Flow

### 1. Create Test Account

Use the sign-up form at `/signup` with test data.

### 2. Check Console (Development)

Look for the logged credentials in browser console.

### 3. Test Sign-in

Use the temporary password to sign in and verify the password change flow.

## Email Templates

The system includes professional HTML email templates with:

- Maigon branding
- Clear instructions
- Security warnings
- Responsive design
- Call-to-action buttons

## Security Features

- Temporary passwords are securely generated
- Email verification is required
- Password strength validation
- Automatic password expiration flags
- Secure password change process

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Edge Functions** to Supabase
2. **Configure Resend** with your domain
3. **Test email delivery** in staging environment
4. **Update email templates** with your branding
5. **Set up monitoring** for email delivery failures

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

1. Check Supabase logs for Edge Function errors
2. Verify RESEND_API_KEY is set correctly
3. Ensure domain is verified in Resend
4. Check Resend dashboard for delivery status

### Password Change Issues

1. Verify user has `hasTemporaryPassword: true`
2. Check user metadata for `is_temporary_password` flag
3. Ensure password meets strength requirements

### Development Testing

Use the console output to get temporary passwords for testing without email delivery.
