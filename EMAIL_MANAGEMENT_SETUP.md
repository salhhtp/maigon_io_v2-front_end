# Email Management Implementation with SendGrid

## Overview

The application implements a professional email management system using **SendGrid** for reliable email delivery:

1. **Sign-up Process**: Users provide their information (no password required)
2. **Temporary Password Generation**: System generates a secure temporary password
3. **Email Delivery**: Credentials are sent via SendGrid to the user
4. **First-time Login**: User signs in with temporary password
5. **Password Change**: User is prompted to change their password immediately

## Why SendGrid?

- **Superior Deliverability**: Better inbox placement and reputation management
- **Advanced Templates**: Dynamic templates with drag-and-drop editor
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Detailed tracking and reporting
- **Enterprise-Grade**: Robust API with excellent documentation
- **Scalability**: Handles high-volume email sending efficiently

## Components Added

### Frontend Components

- **`EmailService`** (`client/services/emailService.ts`)
  - Handles SendGrid email sending logic
  - Supports both dynamic templates and inline HTML
  - Falls back to console logging in development

- **`ChangePassword`** (`client/pages/ChangePassword.tsx`)
  - Password change form for temporary passwords
  - Password strength validation
  - Automatic redirect after successful change

### Backend Integration

- **Supabase Edge Functions**:
  - `send-welcome-email-sendgrid`: Sends welcome emails with credentials via SendGrid
  - `send-password-reset-sendgrid`: Handles password reset emails via SendGrid

### Updated Authentication Flow

- **`SupabaseUserContext`**: Enhanced with temporary password handling
- **`RootRedirect`**: Redirects users with temporary passwords to change-password page
- **`SignIn`**: Handles temporary password detection and routing

## Development Mode

In development, email credentials are logged to console:

```
=== WELCOME EMAIL (DEV MODE - SendGrid) ===
To: user@example.com
Subject: Welcome to Maigon - Your Login Credentials
Temporary Password: Abc123!@#
Login URL: http://localhost:5173/signin
Template: Welcome Template with Dynamic Data
==========================================
```

## Production Setup

### 1. Deploy Supabase Edge Functions

```bash
supabase functions deploy send-welcome-email-sendgrid
supabase functions deploy send-password-reset-sendgrid
```

### 2. Configure SendGrid

#### Step 1: Create SendGrid Account
1. Sign up for [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com)
2. Verify your account and complete setup

#### Step 2: Get API Key
1. Go to Settings > API Keys
2. Create a new API key with "Full Access" or "Mail Send" permissions
3. Copy the API key (you won't see it again)

#### Step 3: Set Environment Variables
```bash
supabase secrets set SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
supabase secrets set SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

### 3. Configure Email Domain Authentication

#### Step 1: Domain Authentication
1. In SendGrid, go to Settings > Sender Authentication
2. Click "Authenticate Your Domain"
3. Add your domain (e.g., `maigon.io`)
4. Follow DNS setup instructions
5. Verify domain authentication

#### Step 2: Single Sender Verification (Alternative)
If you don't have domain access:
1. Go to Settings > Sender Authentication
2. Click "Create a Single Sender"
3. Verify the email address you'll send from

### 4. (Optional) Create Dynamic Templates

SendGrid's dynamic templates provide better email design and management:

#### Step 1: Create Welcome Email Template
1. Go to Email API > Dynamic Templates
2. Create new template called "Welcome Email"
3. Add a version with your design
4. Use these dynamic variables:
   - `{{firstName}}` - User's first name
   - `{{temporaryPassword}}` - Generated password
   - `{{loginUrl}}` - Login page URL
   - `{{year}}` - Current year

#### Step 2: Create Password Reset Template
1. Create another template called "Password Reset"
2. Use these dynamic variables:
   - `{{resetUrl}}` - Password reset URL
   - `{{year}}` - Current year

#### Step 3: Configure Template IDs
```bash
supabase secrets set SENDGRID_WELCOME_TEMPLATE_ID=d-your_welcome_template_id
supabase secrets set SENDGRID_PASSWORD_RESET_TEMPLATE_ID=d-your_reset_template_id
```

## User Flow

### New User Registration

1. User fills out sign-up form (no password field)
2. System creates account with temporary password
3. Welcome email sent with:
   - Login credentials
   - Temporary password
   - Login link
   - Instructions

### First-time Login

1. User receives email with temporary credentials
2. User signs in with temporary password
3. System detects temporary password and redirects to `/change-password`
4. User must change password before accessing the application
5. After password change, user is redirected to dashboard

### Password Requirements

- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)

## Testing the Flow

### 1. Create Test Account

Use the sign-up form at `/signup` with test data.

### 2. Check Console (Development)

Look for the logged credentials in browser console.

### 3. Test Sign-in

Use the temporary password to sign in and verify the password change flow.

## Email Templates

The system supports two approaches for email templates:

### Option 1: Dynamic Templates (Recommended)
- Use SendGrid's visual template editor
- Dynamic content with variables
- A/B testing capabilities
- Easy updates without code changes
- Professional designs

### Option 2: Inline HTML Templates
- HTML templates in the Edge Functions
- Full control over design
- Version-controlled with your code
- Fallback when dynamic templates aren't configured

Both include:
- Maigon branding
- Mobile-responsive design
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Security warnings
- Professional styling

## SendGrid Features Utilized

- **Delivery Analytics**: Track open rates, click rates, bounces
- **Reputation Management**: Automatic IP warming and monitoring
- **Template Management**: Visual editor with version control
- **Deliverability Insights**: Real-time feedback on email performance
- **Event Webhooks**: Track delivery status and user engagement

## Security Features

- Temporary passwords are securely generated
- Email verification is required
- Password strength validation
- Automatic password expiration flags
- Secure password change process
- SendGrid's security and compliance standards

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Edge Functions** to Supabase
2. **Configure SendGrid** with your domain
3. **Set up domain authentication** for better deliverability
4. **Create dynamic templates** (optional but recommended)
5. **Test email delivery** in staging environment
6. **Set up monitoring** for email delivery failures

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

1. Check Supabase logs for Edge Function errors
2. Verify `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is set correctly
3. Ensure domain is authenticated in SendGrid
4. Check SendGrid Activity Feed for delivery status
5. Verify sender authentication (domain or single sender)

### Password Change Issues

1. Verify user has `hasTemporaryPassword: true`
2. Check user metadata for `is_temporary_password` flag
3. Ensure password meets strength requirements

### Development Testing

Use the console output to get temporary passwords for testing without email delivery.
