# Legal Language Style Guide (Professional)

Purpose: ensure outputs use clear, globally recognized legal language suitable for legal professionals.

Principles
- Use defined terms consistently and capitalize them.
- State obligations with shall/must/may; avoid vague qualifiers unless in the source text.
- Prefer established legal verbs such as represent, warrant, covenant, indemnify, and terminate.
- Avoid colloquial phrasing; keep language precise and professional.
- Maintain jurisdiction-neutral drafting unless the contract or playbook specifies otherwise.

Drafting conventions
- Use "shall" for obligations, "may" for permissions, and "must" for required conditions.
- Keep clause headings standard (for example: "Limitation of Liability", "Governing Law").
- Preserve defined terms and clause structure when proposing edits.

Examples
- Prefer: "The Receiving Party shall return or destroy Confidential Information upon termination."
- Avoid: "The recipient should probably delete the info when the deal ends."
