    <p>
      (c) Is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or
      reference to the Confidential Information;
    </p>
    <p>
      (d) Was known to the Receiving Party prior to disclosure by the Disclosing
      Party, as evidenced by written records; or
    </p>
    <p>
      (e) Is required to be disclosed by law, regulation, or court order,
      provided that the Receiving Party provides prompt notice to the Disclosing
      Party and cooperates in seeking protective measures.

      (e) Protect the Confidential Information using the same degree of care
      that it uses to protect its own confidential information, but in no event
      less than reasonable care;
